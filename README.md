# CS300-CourseManagement
In the projects for this course, I tackled the challenge of managing and querying course data efficiently. I initially chose a hash table for its performance in lookups, but later decided to use a vector due to its ordered nature and simplicity, which suited the scale of my data.

Throughout the development, I've learned the importance of understanding data structures and their impact on performance and memory usage. This was evident as I analyzed the trade-offs between vectors, hash tables, and trees, where I considered not just the speed but also the ease of implementation and maintenance.

I encountered roadblocks such as deciding on the optimal data structure and ensuring efficient data loading and retrieval. Overcoming these required a deep dive into the characteristics of each data structure, considering factors like average-case complexity and memory overhead.

This project has significantly broadened my software design approach. I've become more thoughtful about choosing data structures that not only meet the current requirements but also adapt well to future changes. The focus has shifted towards writing maintainable and readable code, with an emphasis on long-term adaptability over short-term gains.

Reflecting on this experience, I realize the importance of balancing theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. It has refined my programming skills, particularly in making decisions that affect both the performance and the clarity of my code.
